This repository includes small Mono example applications in C# that use the RS-485 port of the Raspicomm.

Here is how to use it:

- You will need Mono to use these applications. To install Mono, use this command:
  sudo apt-get install mono-mcs

- Use GIT to clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:
  git clone https://github.com/amescon/rpc-mono-examples.git

- The repository includes the following sample apps:
  - Rs485Write
    Sends "Hello World" over the RS-485 port.
  - Rs485Read
    Receives 10 bytes from the RS-485 port and displays them afterwards.

- Change to the directory of the application that you want to run, e.g.:
  cd rpc-mono-examples/Rs485Write

- Compile the code into an executable:
  make

- Run it, e.g.:
  ./rs485_write

- Time to have some fun! Modify the code, compile it once more and test your changes!
